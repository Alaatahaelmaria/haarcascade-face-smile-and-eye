Detect face , smile and eye by haarcascade Using computer vision 
What are Haar Cascades?
Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location.

This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time. We can train a haar-cascade detector to detect various objects like cars, bikes, buildings, fruits, etc.

Haar cascade uses the cascading window, and it tries to compute features in every window and classify whether it could be an object. For more details on its working
